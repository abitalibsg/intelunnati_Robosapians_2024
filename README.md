# Robosapians_Saintgits College Of Engineering_Develop a 2D Occupancy Grid Map of a Room using Overhead Cameras
Final Report Submission for Intel Unnati Industrial Training
### Description: 
Abstract: This project explores the development of a 2D occupancy grid map of an indoor
environment using a network of overhead RGB cameras, aimed at enhancing Autonomous
Mobile Robot (AMR) navigation. Utilizing the ROS 2 Foxy framework and Gazebo for
simulation, the project seeks to demonstrate the potential for accurate and rapid mapping
in controlled indoor settings. The motivation behind this work stems from the need for
reliable environment mapping to facilitate AMR path planning and obstacle avoidance.
Through a series of methodical steps, including camera calibration, data collection, and
image processing, the project partially succeeded in generating an occupancy grid map
that identifies occupied and unoccupied spaces. The results underscore both the promise
of using overhead cameras for detailed environmental mapping and the challenges related
to calibration precision and data processing. Despite these challenges, the project highlights significant strides towards effective AMR navigation and sets the stage for future
improvements and more comprehensive mapping solutions.
